    <p>Rendang is a deeply flavorful and tender beef stew from the Minangkabau ethnic group in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Known for its rich, complex flavors, rendang is made by simmering beef in coconut milk and a mixture of lemongrass, galangal, garlic, turmeric, ginger, and chilies until the liquid evaporates and the meat becomes tender and infused with the spices.</p>

    <h3 id="judul">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Spice Paste:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Blend all the spice paste ingredients (shallots, garlic, soaked dried chilies, ginger, galangal, ground coriander, ground cumin, and ground turmeric) into a smooth paste using a food processor or blender.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Cook the Spice Paste:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add the spice paste and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring constantly until the paste becomes fragrant and the oil starts to separate.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add the Beef:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the beef cubes to the pot and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add Coconut Milk and Herbs:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour in the coconut milk.</li>

                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Simmer:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning.</li>
                <li>Let it simmer for about 2-3 hours until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Continue cooking until the sauce has reduced and coats the beef, which may take another hour.</li>
                <li>The final dish should have a thick, dry consistency where the oil separates from the sauce.</li>
